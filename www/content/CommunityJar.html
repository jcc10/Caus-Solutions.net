<!-- Why pay you? -->
<h3 class="top_main_heading">Why pay you?</h3>
<p>This website costs money to operate, and at the moment I am operating this business as a... experiment. I don't think that I will ever stop helping people <i>but if I have to get a full time job to support myself I will not have as much time to work on this</i>.
</p>
<h3>What can I do?</h3>
<p>You can donate some money to me! I have set this up to state where you are donating to, such as Neighbourhood Tech-Support, Outreach, or the Fake AD tool!</p>
