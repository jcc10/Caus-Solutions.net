# Caus-Solutions.net
Caus-Solutions.net's website files.

I made this to log how I am moving from a HTML based website (which I did a bit of before hand) to a PHP/MySQL website.

The idea is that all of the website will be on the MySQL website and just the template is on PHP files,
this will make a website that can be edited rather quickly on the back end (Through a UI none the less!)

At the moment it is a copy from the raw site which has a lot of junk I have just neglected to remove, I will be doing that soon!
